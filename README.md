u-boot-imx
==========

This repository is used to track U-Boot for our i.MX6 based
boards: the [SABRE Lite][sabrelite], [Nitrogen6X][nitrogen6x],
[Nitrogen6X SOM][nitrogen6x-som] and [Nitrogen6 Lite][nitrogen6-lite]
based on the main-line
upstream at [http://git.denx.de][denx].

Primary branches include:

* [master](http://github.com/boundarydevices/u-boot-imx6/tree/master): Latest official release of main-line
* [production](http://github.com/boundarydevices/u-boot-imx6/tree/production): The version we're currently shipping on new boards
* [staging](http://github.com/boundarydevices/u-boot-imx6/tree/staging): The version we're working on

[Other branches](http://github.com/boundarydevices/u-boot-imx6/branches) are used for work in progress, sharing experimental code and to
preserve the history for customers who base their efforts on ours.
